# Self_Evolving_RL_PID-AGV
Reinforcement Learning as an adaptive layer over classical industrial control.

Self-evolving Reinforcement Learning agent for adaptive PID tuning in AGV trajectory tracking.
A lightweight, interpretable RL-based approach where the agent dynamically adjusts PID gains online to improve trajectory tracking accuracy and stability under varying conditions.
The project focuses on low-complexity simulation, reproducibility, and industrially compatible control strategies.
